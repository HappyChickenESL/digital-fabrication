  <h1>Digital Chess Board</h1>
  <div>My final project idea is a digital Chess Board.</div>
  <div>I have two nieces who enjoy playing chess but still have a hard time.</div>
  <div>I think it would be a cool idea since I also like chess. </div>
  <div>The basic idea is to first create a Chess Board, ideally with all figures</div>
  <div>Each tile of the chess board would need to be wired to sense the figure that is standing on top of it</div>
  <div>When the figure is picked up, the tiles which the figure can move to, are highlighted</div>
  <div>Furthermore, tiles which are controlled by an enemy unit, could be highlighted red</div>
  <div>A timer could be integrated if you want to play blitz chess with a timer</div>
